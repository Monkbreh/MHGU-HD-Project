# MHGU-HD-Project
A Remaster of MHGU done with several ESRGAN models.
This HD pack aims to remaster low quality 3ds textures found in the switch release of MHXX. 


***Disclaimer: The mod does not work on Yuzu due to a problem in the file structure of the emulator.***



Special thanks to Discord user Luckyguess for his amazing Arc tool and his suggestions :D, if you want to customize which part of my UI mod you want check out this editor he made https://github.com/Luckyguess-0/MHGU-HD-Editor/releases/tag/Release


Also Kuriimu2 devs for the toolkit. (and capcom i suppose)
